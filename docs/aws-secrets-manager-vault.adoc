== Context

Secret managers securely store sensitive data like API keys and passwords, preventing hardcoded secrets and reducing exposure risks. They provide encrypted storage, access control, and automated rotation, ensuring secure management of credentials across distributed applications.
It is crucial, expecially in could environments, to be able to use such services.

== Prerequisites 

A camel integrationt o be deployed on https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[**OpenShift**].

== Goal

Provide a configuration example to retrieve AWS Secrets Manager Secrets and use them in a camel integration.

== Configuration

First of all all of the following could be supported by simply adding
the camel-aws-secrets-manager component to your classpath.

To set up the secret retrieval with AWS Secrets Manager you have to
first authenticate to the AWS Service. The mechanisms are:

Static credentials in application.properties:

....
camel.vault.aws.accessKey = accessKey
camel.vault.aws.secretKey = secretKey
camel.vault.aws.region = region 
....

Default Credentials Provider in application.properties:

....
camel.vault.aws.defaultCredentialsProvider = true
camel.vault.aws.region = region
....

The static credentials could be a Kubernetes/OCP secret or you can mount
a volume containing the AWS credentials file and use the default
credentials provider chain. This is something up to the end user, but
it’s important to stress the fact that AWS encourages the usage of
default credentials provider chains instead of static credentials.

Creating a secret on AWS will require to have access to the AWS Console
or to AWS CLI with create-secret and general secret manager permissions.
In general the suggested way of creating a secret is by using JSON.

You can create a secret through AWS CLI with the following command:

....
aws secretsmanager create-secret –name authsecdb –secret-string \file://secret.json
....

Where the content of secret.json could be something like:

[source,json]
----
{
  "username": "postgresadmin",
  "password": "xxxx",
  "host": "host"
}
----

The secret name will be authsecdb and the secret fields will be
username, password and host.

In the Camel route it will be enough to use the following syntax and the
secrets field will be retrieved.

....
{{aws:authsecdb/host}}
{{aws:authsecdb/username}}
{{aws:authsecdb/password}}
....

For more information about the usable syntax, you can look at https://camel.apache.org/components/4.8.x/aws-secrets-manager-component.html#_using_aws_secrets_manager_property_function[AWS Secrets Manager Property Function]

The Spring Boot and Quarkus runtime have the starter and the extension
related to AWS Secret Manager in their catalogs. The export and export
Kubernetes command from camel-jbang, will automatically add the
dependency in case of the above syntax usage. This should be transparent
to the end user.

The same configuration could be seen on OCP by following the Camel on
OCP Best Practices repository, in particular, the AWS vault section. You
can follow the example for both the runtimes supported by Red Hat Build
of Apache Camel:

== Enabling Secret Refresh

In the section above we saw how to set up and use the AWS Secret Manager
Secrets retrieval. In this section, we’ll focus on introducing the
Secret refresh in the picture. The Camel AWS Secret Manager refresh
feature is based on the Cloudtrail entries related to the monitored
secret. The reloading task will check for new events in relation to the
secret and it will trigger a Camel context reload in case of an update.

The AWS Secrets Refresh function will use the AWS Cloudtrail service to
track events related to secret updates in the Cloudtrail trail. There
are other ways of tracking changes, but all of them require knowing the
secret’s name before creating the infrastructure on AWS.

Enabling the Secret refresh feature doesn’t require any particular
infrastructure operation. We’ll operate only at Camel level, by adding
more properties to the configuration.

The needed additional field for this purpose are:

....
camel.vault.aws.refreshEnabled=true
camel.vault.aws.refreshPeriod=60000
camel.vault.aws.secrets=<secretsName>
camel.main.context-reload-enabled = true
....

Where secretsName is a comma-separated list of secrets names to track
and monitor. It’s not mandatory to specify the parameter, Camel will
take care of monitoring all the secrets for you.

This will be enough to automatically refresh the Camel context on a
secret value update.

The same configuration could be seen on OCP by following the Camel on
OCP Best Practices repository, in particular, the AWS vault section. You
can follow the example for both the runtimes supported by Red Hat Build
of Apache Camel:

== Enabling Secret Refresh with Eventbridge/SQS

The Camel AWS Secret Manager refresh feature is based on the Cloudtrail
entries related to the monitored secret. The reloading task will check
for new events in relation to the secret and it will trigger a Camel
context reload in case of an update. In Camel 4.8.0, we introduced a new
way of using the feature by leveraging the AWS Eventbridge service in
combination with SQS.

The idea is pretty simple: Eventbridge will filter Cloudtrail events
based on rules and for each rule the user is able to set a target. In
our case we create an Eventbridge rule for tracking AWS Secrets Manager
events.

On the AWS side, the following resources need to be created:

* an AWS Couldtrail trail
* an AWS SQS Queue
* an Eventbridge rule of the following kind

[source,json]
----
{
  "source": ["aws.secretsmanager"],
  "detail-type": ["AWS API Call via CloudTrail"],
  "detail": {
    "eventSource": ["secretsmanager.amazonaws.com"]
  }
}
----

User needs to set the a Rule target to the AWS SQS Queue for Eventbridge
rule

User needs to give permission to the Eventbrige rule, to write on the
above SQS Queue. For doing this you’ll need to define a json file like
this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "Policy": {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Id": "<queue_arn>/SQSDefaultPolicy",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Sid": "EventsToMyQueue",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Service": "events.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "sqs:SendMessage",
        "Resource": "<queue_arn>",
        "Condition": {
          "ArnEquals": {
            "aws:SourceArn": "<eventbridge_rule_arn>"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Change the values for queue_arn and eventbridge_rule_arn, save the file
with policy.json name and run the following command with AWS CLI

....
aws sqs set-queue-attributes --queue-url <queue_url> --attributes \file://policy.json
....

where queue_url is the AWS SQS Queue URL of the just created Queue.

The needed additional fields for this purpose are:

....
camel.vault.aws.refreshEnabled=true
camel.vault.aws.refreshPeriod=60000
camel.vault.aws.secrets=<secretsName>
camel.main.context-reload-enabled = true
camel.vault.aws.useSqsNotification=true
camel.vault.aws.sqsQueueUrl=<queue_url>
....

Where secretsName is a comma-separated list of secrets names to track
and monitor. It’s not mandatory to specify the parameter, Camel will
take care of monitoring all the secrets for you.

This will be enough to automatically refresh the Camel context on a
secret value update.

This approach with Eventbridge is probably the most reliable among the
solutions we have. Mainly because we are going to search only for
Secrets Manager events instead of Cloudtrail full events list.
